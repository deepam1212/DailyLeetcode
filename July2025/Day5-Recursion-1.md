**Why Recursion:** 
* Pre-requisite of backtracking, Trees, D.p. Graphs, LinkedList

**Sorting Algo:**
Merge Sort, Quick Sort

**What is Recursion:** 
Function calling itself, breaking a problem in to subproblem/ smaller parts then that is called recursion

**Sum of First N Natural Numners:**

1+2+3+4+5....N
```swift
func sumOfNNatural(n: Int) -> Int {
    if n <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    return n + sumOfNNatural(n: n - 1)
}
sumOfNNatural(n: 5)
```

First it will run for 5, then for 4, 3, 2, 1 and for 0 it is returning 0 directly so no recursive call for n = 0 and thus it stops at 0

**Factorial of a Number N**

```swift
func factorial(n: Int) -> Int {
    if n > 1 {
        return n * factorial(n: n - 1)
    } else {
        return 1
    }
}
print("factorial: \(factorial(n: 5))")
```

So for 5 it works as return 5 * factorial(5-1), then it runs for 4,3,2 respectively, and for 1 it does not run the recursive call, so it stops at here

Recursion works using a stackâ€”specifically, the call stack of the system.

Here's how it works:
When a function calls itself recursively:

The current function call is pushed onto the call stack.

Each recursive call keeps adding a new frame to the stack.

Once the base condition is met, the calls start returning one by one.

As each call returns, its frame is popped off the stack.

**Print Increasing order of N Natural:**
```swift
func printIncreasing(n: Int) {
    if n == 0 { return }
    printIncreasing(n: n - 1)
    print(n)
}
```

**Ohhhh kkkkkkk it means for n = 5**

* It will add 5 in a call stack, then add 4 on the top of it then 3 on it then 2 then 1 and for n = 0 the base condition hits
* Then as stack removes from the top it will print 1,2,3,4,5
  
**Nth Fibonacci**
