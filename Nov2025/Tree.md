**Tree: - Non Linear Data Structure**


**SubTree: Any part of a tree is a SubTree like Leaf Node is also condidered as a SubTree, or a single node is also called a SubTree, A subtree is a portion of a tree, but that subtree, shoild also be a tree, it is not like you take somes nodes randomly**

height is considered as a length of longest path from root to decendent leaf node, we can pick any node in a tree to calculate the height
A general tree has no restriction of having maximum nodes, but we have to deal with Binary Tree, & a binary tree has atmost 2 children

Left part of a Root Node is called Left Sub Tree(LST) & corrospondingly right part is called as Right Sub Tree (RST).

* **Proper Tree:** Every Node has either 0 or 2 children
* **Complete Tree:** All levels except for the last level must be completely filled from Left to Right
* **Perfect Tree:** All Levels are completely filled

* Pre-Order = Root L R (Pre means Root will be printed pre means first)
* In-Order = L Root R (In between your chikdren you are visiting your Node)
* Post Order = L R Root (Post means Root will be printed post means after childrens)
