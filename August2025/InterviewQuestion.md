**Meeting Rooms:**


need to have a meeting room, example [[1,3], [3,5], [5,6]], so if the overlap is there rhen we need more meeting room as in this example we only need 1 meeting room as there is no meeting room
```swift
[[1,4], [2,5], [7,9],[3,6]]

1------------4
     2------------5
                        7---------9
          3----------6
```
So, total meeting rooms that are required is 3
This question is done by Prefix Sum

**Given a nearly sorted Array, we need to sort the complete array:**
```swift
let arr: [Int] = [13, 22, 31, 45, 11, 20, 48, 60, 50]
k = 4
```

**Question: Find the closest Pair:**

[100, 200, 300, 100, 200, 100, 300]

so the slosest pair is 100, 100 which have 200 in between, so Brute Force is 2 loops and then check  A[i] == A[j] and j - i
