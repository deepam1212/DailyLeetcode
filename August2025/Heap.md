**Finding the total Cost in connecting the Ropes:**


**Bruite Force:**

Sort the total Ropes

example [1,2,3,4]

Total Cost is 19

1 + 2 = 3
then [3,3,4], 3 + 3 = 6

then [6, 4] then 6 + 4 = 10

Total Cost = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

**Optimized Solution Using Heap:**

**Heaps can add a Value in log(n) and remove a value in log(n)**

**Heap is nothing but a Binary Tree**


Formula to find parent index
parentIndex = (i - 1) / 2
